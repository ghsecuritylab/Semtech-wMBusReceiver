# Semtech-wMBusReceiver
wmBusReceiver with SX1272 / RF95-SX1276: see RT-STM32L476RG-NUCLEO64-SX1272.

To get an idea of what is changed in "official" drivers from https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node compare directories under RT-STM32L476RG-NUCLEO64-SX1272/drivers/src with same directories from RT-STM32L476RG-NUCLEO64-SX1272/doc/LoRaMac-node-master.zip/LoRaMac-node-master/src.

The project is based on ChibiOS. To compile the project download https://osdn.net/projects/chibios/downloads/70767/ChibiStudio_Windows_Preview21.7z first. After unpacking replace chibios182 folder with that from Semtech-wMBusReceiver.
